=================

**Frequency Analsysis as basic idea**:
If every input symbol s in the cypher is mapped to a fixed output symbol 
c(s), the propability p(s) of s occuring in any given message of the language 
should correlate to the propability p(c(s)) occuring in ceasars message.

Step 1
------
Find the propability of any given english letter occuring in a english message:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_frequency

Step 2
------

I wrote a perl script, that counts the occurance of a symbol in a message, and 
prints the letter, count, and propability of that symbol to stdout.

~~~~perl
#!/bin/perl -w 

my %seen = ();
my $total = 0;

while( <STDIN> ){
	while ($_ =~ /(.)/g) {
    $seen{$1}++;
    $total++;
	}
}

print "symbol | frequency | probability\n";
print "-------|-----------|------------\n";
foreach my $symbol (keys(%seen)) {
	print pack("A6",$symbol) . " | " .  pack("A9", $seen{$symbol} ) . " | " .  (100.00 * $seen{$symbol}/$total) . "\n";
}
~~~~



**Result:**


symbol | frequency | probability
-------|-----------|------------
w      | 5         | 0.3424
a      | 153       | 10.4794
r      | 42        | 2.8767

h      | 26        | 1.7808
k      | 18        | 1.2328
g      | 38        | 2.6027
.      | 5         | 0.3424
;      | 3         | 0.2054
f      | 89        | 6.0958
t      | 30        | 2.0547
i      | 85        | 5.8219
e      | 29        | 1.9863
n      | 21        | 1.4383
       | 252       | 17.260
m      | 63        | 4.3150
v      | 26        | 1.7808
s      | 50        | 3.4246
l      | 106       | 7.2602
c      | 71        | 4.8630
b      | 12        | 0.8219
q      | 15        | 1.0273
z      | 1         | 0.0684
o      | 110       | 7.5342


The " " (blank) is  the most frequent symbol. I guessed that it is, in fact 
the blank symbol in the message.

The next most frequent symbol is "a" - if the message is indeed in english,
and the frequencies are not that disturbed, that could correspond to "e" 
in the message.

Step 3 - naive substitution
----------------------------

I created a simple map, where i assigned each symbol in my table the symbol 
of the english language frequency table, that had the same rank.

The resulting map was:

~~~~perl
#!/bin/perl -w
%map = (
" " => " ",
"a" => "E",
"o" => "T",
"l" => "A",
"f" => "O",
"i" => "I",
"y" => "N",
"x" => "S",
"c" => "R",
"m" => "H",
"s" => "D",
"r" => "L",
"g" => "U",
"t" => "C",
"e" => "M",
"h" => "F",
"v" => "Y",
"d" => "W",
"," => "G",
"n" => "P",
"k" => "B",
"q" => "V",
"b" => "K",
"w" => "X" );

while( <STDIN> ){
	while ($_ =~ /(.)/g) {
    if( exists($map{$1}) ){
    	print $map{$1};    	
  	}
  	else {
  		print "#";
  	}
	}
	print "\n";
}
~~~~

using that maping, the message transformed into:

Step 4 - Tweaking the table 
---------------------------

### Iteration 1

I couldnt yet read the text, but some familiar patterns emerged. 

The string "TNE" for example was repeated often, and could very well be "THE".
So i tried swapping N and H in my map.

The resulting text was ... astonishingly promising:


*LAENASG HAPIOC DEUAYED TVR DAYN IO THAT KUALEG BELAFNE HE HAD AOTILIKATED THATG IO THE OATFSAU LRFSNE RM EPEOTNG NFLH VRFUD BE THE LRODFLT RM PESLIOCETRSIXG UEAPEN THE ASWY FODES KSETEONE RM SAINIOC SELSFITN AOD LAPAUSY# HE KUALEN BSFTFNG A YRFOC WAOG IO LRWWAOD RM THENE MRSLEN# HE CIPEN HIW IONTSFLTIRON THAT THE LAPAUSY NHRFUD SAOCE AN EXTEONIPEUY AN KRNNIBUE IO AUU DISELTIRON# THAT HE VRFUD EXEST HIWNEUM ORT TR BE ABNEOT MSRW THE LAWK UROCES THAO THSEE DAYN# HAPIOC ASSAOCED THENE WATTESNG HE WASLHEN TR PIEOOA BY AN UROC #RFSOEYN AN HE LAOG VHEO HIN RVO NRUDIESN DID ORT EXKELT HIW# MIODIOC THESE A MSENH BRDY RM LAPAUSYG VHILH HE HAD NEOT RO TR THAT KUALE NEPESAU DAYN BEMRSEG WASLHIOC IOLENNAOTUY OICHT AOD DAYG HE ADPAOLED SAKIDUY THSRFCH THE TESSITRSY RM THE AEDFI IOTR THAT RM THE UIOCROENG IO VHILH TVR UECIRON VESE VIOTESIOCG THATG IM AOY KUAO AMMELTIOC HIN RVO NAMETY NHRFUD HAPE BEEO RSCAOI#ED BY THE AEDFIG HE WICHT DEMEAT IT BY THE SAKIDITY RM HIN WRPEWEOTN# VHEO HE ASSIPED THESEG HE NEODN IOMRSWATIRO TR THE SENT RM THE UECIRONG AOD CATHESN AUU HIN ASWY IOTR ROE KUALE BEMRSE IOTEUUICEOLE RM HIN ASSIPAU LRFUD BE AOORFOLED TR THE ASPESOI# PESLIOCETRSIXG RO HEASIOC THIN LISLFWNTAOLEG UEADN BAL# HIN ASWY IOTR THE LRFOTSY RM THE BITFSICEN# AOD AMTES WASLHIOC MSRW IT TR CESCRPIAG A TRVO RM THE BRIIG VHRW LAENAS HAD NETTUED THESE AMTES DEMEATIOC THEW IO THE HEUPETIAO VASG AOD HAD SEODESED TSIBFTASY TR THE AEDFIG HE DETESWIOED TR ATTAL# IT#*

### Iteration 2
Some words THAT, THE, BE ... looked good, others where nearly correct.

"IO" could be "IS" and DEUAYED could be DELAYED

swapping N for S and U to L i got:

*UAESANG HAPIOC DELAYED TVR DAYS IO THAT KLAUEG BEUAFSE HE HAD AOTIUIKATED THATG IO THE OATFNAL URFNSE RM EPEOTSG SFUH VRFLD BE THE URODFUT RM PENUIOCETRNIXG LEAPES THE ANWY FODEN KNETEOSE RM NAISIOC NEUNFITS AOD UAPALNY# HE KLAUES BNFTFSG A YRFOC WAOG IO URWWAOD RM THESE MRNUES# HE CIPES HIW IOSTNFUTIROS THAT THE UAPALNY SHRFLD NAOCE AS EXTEOSIPELY AS KRSSIBLE IO ALL DINEUTIROS# THAT HE VRFLD EXENT HIWSELM ORT TR BE ABSEOT MNRW THE UAWK LROCEN THAO THNEE DAYS# HAPIOC ANNAOCED THESE WATTENSG HE WANUHES TR PIEOOA BY AS LROC #RFNOEYS AS HE UAOG VHEO HIS RVO SRLDIENS DID ORT EXKEUT HIW# MIODIOC THENE A MNESH BRDY RM UAPALNYG VHIUH HE HAD SEOT RO TR THAT KLAUE SEPENAL DAYS BEMRNEG WANUHIOC IOUESSAOTLY OICHT AOD DAYG HE ADPAOUED NAKIDLY THNRFCH THE TENNITRNY RM THE AEDFI IOTR THAT RM THE LIOCROESG IO VHIUH TVR LECIROS VENE VIOTENIOCG THATG IM AOY KLAO AMMEUTIOC HIS RVO SAMETY SHRFLD HAPE BEEO RNCAOI#ED BY THE AEDFIG HE WICHT DEMEAT IT BY THE NAKIDITY RM HIS WRPEWEOTS# VHEO HE ANNIPED THENEG HE SEODS IOMRNWATIRO TR THE NEST RM THE LECIROSG AOD CATHENS ALL HIS ANWY IOTR ROE KLAUE BEMRNE IOTELLICEOUE RM HIS ANNIPAL URFLD BE AOORFOUED TR THE ANPENOI# PENUIOCETRNIXG RO HEANIOC THIS UINUFWSTAOUEG LEADS BAU# HIS ANWY IOTR THE URFOTNY RM THE BITFNICES# AOD AMTEN WANUHIOC MNRW IT TR CENCRPIAG A TRVO RM THE BRIIG VHRW UAESAN HAD SETTLED THENE AMTEN DEMEATIOC THEW IO THE HELPETIAO VANG AOD HAD NEODENED TNIBFTANY TR THE AEDFIG HE DETENWIOED TR ATTAU# IT#*




### Iteration 3 

still not perfect, but more combinations emerged: 

KRSSIBLE could very well mean "POSSIBLE" making K<->P and R<->O my next choice 
yielding:

About the cypher
================

i couldn't find a simple *key* that would allow me to create the transformation
table. So i would have to provide the whole table to someone, who wanted to 
decrypt messages.

I would descripe the cypher as a **simple substitution cipher** where the
following table is the *key*:

~~~~perl
%map = (
" " => " ",
"a" => "E",
"o" => "T",
"l" => "A",
"f" => "N",
"i" => "I",
"y" => "H",
"x" => "R",
"c" => "O",
"m" => "S",
"s" => "D",
"r" => "C",
"g" => "L",
"t" => "G",
"e" => "F",
"h" => "U",
"v" => "Y",
"d" => "M",
"," => ",",
"n" => "V",
"k" => "B",
"q" => "W",
"b" => "P",
"w" => "X", 
"j" => "K",
"." => ".",
":" => ":",
";" => ";");
~~~~


Each imput symbol *s* from the message is mapped to a single symbol *c(s)* in
the cyphered message. The mapping is fixed - the function described by the map
is bijective.
